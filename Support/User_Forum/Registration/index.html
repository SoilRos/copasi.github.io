    <h1>User Forum Registration</h1>
    <p>
      Posting to the COPASI User Forum is limited to registered
      members to prevent spamming. To post and reply via the web or
      email, you will need to have a  
      <a target="_blank" title="Google account"
         href="https://myaccount.google.com/" >
        Google account
      </a>. 
      If you use any non-GMail addresses, make sure to 
      <a target="_blank" title="associate"
         href="https://accounts.google.com/b/0/EditUserInfo" >
        associate
      </a>
      those with your Google account. This will allow you to send
      e-mail replies to the group and, importantly, have the group
      automatically recognize you as the same user as from your
      Google account. You should also be able to set up a non-GMail
      address as your primary e-mail, when you set up a Google
      account.
