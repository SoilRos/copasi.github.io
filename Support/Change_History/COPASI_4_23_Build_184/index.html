          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where derived units where not correctly displayed in the global quantities widget.
          </li>
          <li>
            Common Names edited directly in the report definition are now resolved.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where some window types (sliders, etc.) remained in the open window menu, after they were closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where fit result eigenvalues took up way to much space in the display.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure the "unsaved model" warning dialog appears after reactions are added,

          </li>

            is otherwise constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            The elements of the column 'Summation Error' in the MCA results are now accessible in reports and plots.

            algorithms: Particle Swarm, Praxes, GASR, and SRES.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash in parameter estimation with cross-validation in the case that a fitted parameter was not found.
