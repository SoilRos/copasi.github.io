    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.33 (Build 246)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            In any file save dialog the base name of the currently loaded model is the default instead of untitled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved the display of complex units.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved layout of the Lyapunov exponent results to provide more space for the exponent table. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Prevent crash when entering a reaction with species whose name is a valid number. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The statistics and the fitting plots are again correctly calculated and displayed for a stopped parameter tasks.
          </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Avogadro constant has been updated to it's final value: 6.02214076 x 10^23
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Standards
        <ul>
          <li>
            SBML: Fixed problems importing and exporting mathematical expressions using Avogadro's number.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML: Fixed import of mathematical expression using functions without any arguments.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML: Fixed occasional crash when importing the same SBML file twice in a row.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Language Bindings
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occurring when deleting several species at once, i.e., without compiling the model after each delete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash when deleting a function which is still in use in the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash when creating an expression with numbers in the German format like 1,2.
          </li>
