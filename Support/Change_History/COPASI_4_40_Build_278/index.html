    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.39 (Build 272)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where loading a parameter estimation protocol in which the values had been sorted externally lead to incorrect parameter mapping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show both modification and creation time entities in local time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed plot for parameter estimation results for steady state experiments to properly map the independent data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The parameter estimation result now includes a counter for failed constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash when deleting all global quantities.
          </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed temporary directory for export of Combine and Shiny archives to address security restrictions on MacOS X.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stochastic simulation methods now correctly report whether they support events and thus whether they can be used for the simulation of model with events.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Standards 
        <ul>
          <li>
            SBML import: Fixed issue where it was not possible to change the delay of an imported event.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML import: Fixed crash caused by particular unit definitions during importing.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML import: Fixed import of reaction kinetics which occasionally lost the parameter mapping.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML import: Handle references to missing modifier species in reactions gracefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBML export: Reduced warnings about Model History not being exported to only check the model itself and not all model components.
          </li>
        </ul>
