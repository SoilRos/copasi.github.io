    <h3 >Version 4.26.213</h3>
    Release Date: July 31, 2019<br />
    <h4>New Features since COPASI 4.25 (Build 207)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added feature to open files directly from a web page which use the link format: 'copasi://'.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is to possible to specify a user selected list of time point for output in the trajectory tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now possible to enable automated checks for updates of COPASI as you are used to in many
            other applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            We added a tool to remove SBML Ids from the COPASI file which are used to facilitate referencing the
            original SBML Id on export. When an object was renamed the original SBML Id is preserved which is
            desired in most cases. However there are circumstances where this behavior is not desired. Removing
            the SBML Ids leads to newly created Id based on the names in COPASI.
          </li>
          <li>
            A COPASI file downloaded using the 'Open URL' method has the targets of reports removed so that a
            malicious user cannot automatically create harmful content.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Command-line (CopasiSE)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added option to export ant import different parameterizations of the model through
            simple ini file.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.25 (Build 207)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed a problem where saving a COPASI file to a different location lost the experimental data
            in the parameter estimation task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed erroneous message and editing problems for models where the volume of a compartment is dependent
            on a contained species' concentration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed an issue where tab navigation in the trajectory task widget lead to confusing behavior when
            synchronizing the interval size and number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed a sorting problem in the trajectory task result table which was sorting lexicographically instead
            numerically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed a crash in the reaction widget which could occur when the reaction parameter were previously deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issues with entering numbers in the scan parameter fields when the local decimal separator is not a
            '.' (dot).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed exporting of model parameter sets to exclude non numeric values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed a crash occurring occasionally after editing changing the preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed editing number in scientific notation in the slider dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem with species containing species when editing the chemical equation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improved steady state detection which was overly conservative when estimating the progress for a
            singular systems Jacobian.
          </li>
