    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.15 (Build 95)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            The tool "Create Events For Time-series Experiment" does now handle ignored columns correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix issue where deleting a reaction and running a parameter estimation afterward 
            could cause the initial values to be corrupted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem in the tool "Convert to irreversible" which could lead to crashes if a 
            reaction parameter of a reversible reaction was referenced out side the reaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed handling of HTML entities like <code>&amp;mdash;</code> in notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved performance of the "Update MIRIAM" tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Warning about unknown MIRIAM resources are now only issued when the resource is accessed.
          </li>
          <li>
            All available tasks are now selectable as sub-tasks for the Optimization task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where copying a compartment could lead to a crash in COPASI.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed problem in the Linear Noise Approximation task which occasionally lead to
            crashes in COPASI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue in the Parameter Estimation Task where the un-normalized weight would not
            be calculated correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The recently introduced Persistent Trigger flag for events was not correctly read 
            from files causing the default value to be used. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Numerical instability issues in the Metabolic Control Analysis task result in a 
            warning reported to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed erroneous error messages caused by a premature function compile during when loading a file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue were HTML notes not save correctly when the user added the name space 
            manually to the top level element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Renaming an object triggers now an immediate update of the infix of all mathematical 
            expression where the object is referenced.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved handling of experimental data files for parameter estimation which are not in the same
            directory as the the COPASI file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where incorrect numerical values for parameter bounds in Optimization or
            Parameter Estimation would lead to an occasional crash. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> SBML
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where COPASI could crash when loading and SBML file, which contains 
            the same model name as the currently loaded model in COPASI.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
