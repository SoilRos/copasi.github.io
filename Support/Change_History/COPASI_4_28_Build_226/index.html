    <h3 >Version 4.28.226</h3>
    Release Date: June 12, 2020<br />
    <h4>New Features since COPASI 4.27 (Build 217)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Performance improvements while switching to tables of species and reactions or the parameter overview
            for large models through deferred loading.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added line numbers to table of items in the report definition widget.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now possible to add/merge SBML models to the currently loaded model.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is no possible to change the order of plot items and thus controlling the order in the legend.

          <li>
            Fixed undo of MIRIAM annotation for species. reactions, compartments, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash when switching a species, compartment, or global quantity with a noise term assigned
            to no longer be of simulation type ODE.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash caused by saving of existing plots after another model has been loaded into COPASI.
