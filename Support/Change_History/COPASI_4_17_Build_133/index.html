    <h4 >New Features since COPASI 4.16 (Build 104)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Support for user defined units.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extended unit selection options for time, volume and quantity of the model. 
            These extended options include user defined units.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unit support for Global Quantities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Undo and redo support for all model changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved user interface to method parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selection of matrix and vector elements by name in addition to the index for plots, reports, 
            and in mathematicsl expressions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for contour plots.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>
          <li>
            New hybrid simulation algorithm: (Hybrid RK-45) which supports arbitrary discrete events and user
            defined ODEs. Additionally, the user can specify which reaction are treated continously and which
            are treated discretely. This algorithm passes the SBML semantic test suite and stochastic suite.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> SBML
        <ul>
          <li>
            Full support for SBML Level 3.1 event semantics
          </li>
          <li>
            Import and export of unit definitions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
