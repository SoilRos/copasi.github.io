    <h4 >New Features since COPASI 4.16 (Build 104)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Support for user defined units.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extended unit selection options for time, volume and quantity of the model. 
            These extended options include user defined units.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unit support for Global Quantities.
          </li>

            Undo and redo support for all model changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved user interface to method parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selection of matrix and vector elements by name in addition to the index for plots, reports, 
            and in mathematical expressions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for contour plots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sorting off all analysis result tables is now enabled where approriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The MCA results contain now information whether the summation theorems are violated or not 
            allowing the user to easily evaluate the numerical accuracy of the result.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now possible to the select the units of the rate low for a reaction as either amount per time
            or concentration per time. If concentration per time is selected and the reaction participates in 
            multiple compartments the scaling compartment can be selectd.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added support for arbitrary events to the Stochastic Direct Method.
          </li>
          <li>
            New hybrid simulation algorithm: (Hybrid RK-45) which supports arbitrary discrete events and user
            defined ODEs. Additionally, the user can specify which reaction are treated continously and which
            are treated discretely. This algorithm passes the SBML semantic test suite and stochastic suite.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now possible to report or plot only the internal steps taken by the integration algorithm in 
            the trajecctory task.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> SBML
        <ul>
          <li>
            Full support for SBML Level 3.1 event semantics
          </li>
          <li>
            Import and export of unit definitions.
          </li>
          <li>
            SBOTerms are no imported and displayed as part of the MIRIAM annotation. On export a the first SBOTerm
            of the MIRIAM annotation is used if the SBML entity does not have the SBOTerm set.
          </li>
