    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.30 (Build 240)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added error message opening a model by URL failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occurring when deleting on object while editing the MIRIAM annotation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved detection of SED-ML files when dragging and dropping it in the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added option to disable JIT compilation in the COPASI configuration file and preference dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            The current user credentials (if defined) are automatically added as the creator to new models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve visualization of optimization methods.
          </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improved performance of detecting whether changing of initial concentration or initial particle number may be prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occurring in certain situation when a loaded with piece wise defined functions model cannot be compiled. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved JIT compilation which could cause stack overflow when compiling very large expression caused by moieties or very large models (thousands of reactions).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed loading COPASI files which contains invalid curve types for plots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed rarely occurring crash in the direct stochastic algorithm caused by floating point rounding errors.
          </li>

      </li>
       <li> Standards
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improved exporting of time course duration to SED-ML avoiding rounding errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed export and import of nested scan tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved detection of COPASI files in Combine archives which are marked as xml.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed export of events with assignments which contained a redundant unary plus.
          </li>
