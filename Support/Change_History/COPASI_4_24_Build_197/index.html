    <h3 >Version 4.24.197</h3>
    Release Date: July 30, 2018<br />
    <h4>New Features since COPASI 4.23 (Build 184)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented a new 3d bar graph view of matrixes allowing for better selection of interesting values.
            The new view also avoids OpenGL issues due to incomplete graphic card support of the OS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved issue display in the object browser which did not recognize missing expressions
            for entities of type ODE and occasionally marked missing initial expressions when not required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved display of advanced method parameters. If advanced parameter usage is indicated in the
            preferences they will be shown last. If it is not selected non advanced parameters which are not
            at their value will be shown to inform the user.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> SBML
        <ul>
          <li>
            Models which explicitely reference Avogadro's number can now be exported to SBML.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.23 (Build 184)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed crash during reload of a model while the dependency window is open.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved dependency tracking when deleting a reaction, which was to conservative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved dependency tracking when deleting a species, which did not check for use
            as a modifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed a crash occurring when changing reaction kinetics in a model which has
            discontinuities in the ODE system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed a problem where editing the equation of a reaction in the table view could lead to a crash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occasionally occurring when executing a task in a second or third model in the same
            COPASI session.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem leading to a crash caused by a spectrogram plot referencing invalid objects for display. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improved load of corrupted COPASI files with an incomplete reaction modifier list. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash in cross section task.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> SBML
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fixed problems loading layout and render information caused by changes in libSBML.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
     <li> SED-ML
        <ul>
          <li>
            SED-ML export will always use SBML Level 3.1
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed import problem when loading an SED-ML file containing a report.
          </li>
