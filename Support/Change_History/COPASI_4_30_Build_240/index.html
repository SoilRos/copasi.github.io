    <h4>Bug Fixes since COPASI 4.29 (Build 228)</h4>

      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Loading a model parameter set with a name already in the model is no longer silently ignored.
            Instead a new unique name is generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed dragging an dropping of report items which may cause a crash in certain situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved layout of parameter estimation result widgets to better display Eigenvalues of the Fisher
            Information Matrix.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem where the deletion of a just created parameter set could cause a crash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed update of local reaction parameters in the parameter overview, which was not correctly refreshed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem updating the separator when editing a report definition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved display of Elementary Flux Mode results where some table rows were not correctly adjusted. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved object selection for Time Course Sensitivity task to include only and all relevant objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed loading of XHTML comments including entities like &pi; (&amp;pi;).
          </li>
          <li>
            Updated MIRIAM resources to correctly handle identifiers using https://.
          </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Temporary Files for user with special characters in the name is now correctly handled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue with Hybrid LSODA integration method which was not correctly initialized on its initial use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed an issue where it was not possible to read extremely old COPASI files using user defined functions
            with recent versions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed file permissions for COPASI files which in some situation under Linux did not respect umask settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed report output of Elementary Flux Mode task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed tracking of  wall clock and CPU time in the Sensitivities Task.
          </li>

       <li> Standards
        <ul>
