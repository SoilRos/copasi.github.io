    <p>The Java and Python language bindings for COPASI allow you to use the C++ API of COPASI from Java or Python.
      These
      language bindings are a work in progress. They come as they are and while we currently do not have a lot of
      documentation
      available for them, we are happy to assist you in any problems you encounter.
    </p>
    <p>The best way toget familiar with the bindings, is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the <a title="Technical Documatation" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Technical_Documentation/">technical documentation</a></li>
      <li>Look at the provided examples: <a href="https://github.com/copasi/COPASI/tree/develop/copasi/bindings/java/examples" target="_blank">Java</a> | 
        <a href="https://github.com/copasi/COPASI/tree/develop/copasi/bindings/python/examples" target="_blank">Python</a></li>
      <li>contact us on our <a title="User Forum" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Forum/">User Forum</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do provide a build of the language bindings, on our <a title="COPASI: Download"
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download/">download</a> page, if you need language bindings for any other
      operating system or other versions of Java and/or python, you have to
      compile the bindings from the source code. Instructions on how to compile the bindings from the sources can be
      found
      <a title="COPASI: Support/Installation/Language Bindings/Compiling from Source"
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Installation/Language_Bindings/Compiling_from_Source/">here</a>.</p>
