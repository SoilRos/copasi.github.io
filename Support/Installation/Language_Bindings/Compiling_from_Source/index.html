    <p>In order to compile the bindings from source, you have to download the COPASI sources either from
    <a title="COPASI: Download" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download">our download section</a>
    or from our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/copasi/COPASI" rel="external">github repository</a>.</p>
    <p>You will also need a number of dependencies installed, the easiest thing is to go and grab the copasi-dependencies
      project, where we have bundled all the dependency open source projects that we use. For the landuage bindings you 
      won't need to have Qt installed. Just follow the steps as described here: 
    </p> 
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/copasi/copasi-dependencies/blob/master/readme.md"
          rel="external">General Instructions</a>
      </li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/copasi/copasi-dependencies/blob/master/readme_linux.md"
          rel="external">Linux build instructions</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The language bindings are created using SWIG, additionally you will need CMake, to configure the project, and of course
      the development packages for the programming language that you want to build for. Our CMake scripts has the option for 
      the following language bindings: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_CSHARP=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for .NET.</li>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_JAVA=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for Java.</li>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_PYTHON=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for Python.</li>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_R=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for R.</li>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_PERL=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for Perl.</li>
      <li><b>-DENABLE_OCTAVE=ON</b>: This will create the language bindings for Octave.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So for example, on a system with java installed (and the jdk dev package, cmake, swig) you would create the python bindings
      like so:
    </p>
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/copasi/COPASI
mkdir build_copasi
cd build_copasi
cmake -DBUILD_GUI=OFF -DENABLE_JAVA=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/copasi -DCOPASI_DEPENDENCY_DIR=../copasi-dependencies/bin ../COPASI
make
make install</pre>
    
    <p>If you are compiling on Visual Studio on Windows, we recommend that you do define the flag: <b>-DWITH_STATIC_RUNTIME=ON</b>
    for both the copasi-dependencies project, as well as COPASI, as otherwise you will have to ensure that the matching Visual 
  Studio Runtime is installed wherever you want to use the bindings.</p>
