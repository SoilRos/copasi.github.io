API documentation is currently only available for the stable release COPASI 4.16 (Build 103) and can be found <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/API_Documentation/" >here</a>. In the future we intend to provide online API documentation also for the latest development releases if they are newer than the stable release.<br />
<br />
The API documentation is still under development and not complete but we hope that it is already of some help for people working with the COPASI libraries, which can be build from the source packages available from the <a title="COPASI: Download" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download/" >download area</a>.<br />
