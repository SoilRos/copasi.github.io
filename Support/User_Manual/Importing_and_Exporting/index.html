    <p>COPASI is one modeling and simulation tool among many and often people use more than one tool to create, investigate
    and simulate their models. In order to make it easier to exchange model files with other programs, COPASI supports
    reading and writing of several model file formats. Naturally COPASI can read and write it's own file format and it
    can read Gepasi files just as well although it will not write Gepasi files.</p>

    <p>In addition to those two file formats, COPASI can import SBML files, SED-ML files and COMBINE Archives, it can export models as SBML
    , SED-ML, COMBINE Archives as well as C source code, XPPaut, or Berkeley Madonna files.</p>
