    A very important property of steady-state metabolic systems was uncovered with the MCA formalism. This concerns the
    summation of all the flux control coefficients of a pathway. By various procedures [<a

    given reference flux the sum of all flux-control coefficients (of all steps) is equal to unity:<br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">$$\sum_{i} C_{v_{i}}^{J} = 1 $$</div>
    <br />
    For a given reference species concentration the sum of all concentration-control coefficients is zero:<br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">$$\sum_{i} C_{v_{i}}^{[M]} = 0$$</div>
    <br />
    where the summations are over all the steps of the system.<br />
    <br />
    According to the first summation theorem, increases in some of the flux-control coefficients imply decreases in the
    others so that the total remains unity. As a consequence of the summation theorems, one concludes that the control
    coefficients are global properties and that in metabolic systems, control is a systemic property, dependent on all
    of the system's elements (steps).<br />
