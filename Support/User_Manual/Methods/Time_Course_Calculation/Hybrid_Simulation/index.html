<h3 name="Hybrid_Runge_Kutta_">Hybrid (Runge-Kutta)</h3>
This hybrid simulation method developed by us combines a deterministic numerical integration of ODEs with a stochastic simulation algorithm. The whole biochemical network is partitioned into a deterministic and a stochastic subnet internally. The deterministic subnet contains all reactions, in which only species with high particle numbers take part. All reactions with at least one low-numbered species are in the stochastic subnet, because here stochastic effects are expected. Which particle numbers are considered low or high can be specified by the user with the Lower Limit and the Upper Limit parameters (Species with particle numbers between those limits do not change their status. This leads to a hysteresis-like behavior and avoids many unnecessary swaps, if the particle numbers fluctuate in the middle range). The partitioning of the biochemical network can change dynamically during the simulation. After a certain number of steps, which the user can define using the parameter Partitioning Interval, the partitioning is recalculated using the current particle numbers in the system. During one run the deterministic subnet and the stochastic subnet are simulated in parallel. A 4th-order Runge-Kutta method is used to numerically integrate the deterministic part of the system. For the stochastic part the simulation method by Gibson and Bruck [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Bibliography#Gibson00/" >Gibson00</a>] is utilized. The reaction probabilities of the stochastic subnet are approximated as constant during one stochastic step, even though in theory they can change due to the effects of the deterministic subnet.<br />
<br />
The current implementation of the Hybrid Runge Kutta Method is very inefficient when the model contains assignment rules, which leads to extended calculation times.<br />
