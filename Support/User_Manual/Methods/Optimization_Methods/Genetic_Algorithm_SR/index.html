    The genetic algorithm with stochastic ranking is very similar to the before described with tournament selection.
    With two exception which are the mutations are not forced to be within the boundaries and the selection is done
    through a bubble sort with a random factor as described in [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography"

    <ul>
      <li> Parameters are encoded in genes using floating-point representation, rather than the more usual binary
        representation.
      </li>
      <li> Mutation is carried out by adding to the gene a random number drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean
        and a standard deviation of 10% of the parameter value. Parameters may exceed boundaries. Whenever this happens
        or a constraint to the solution is violated the square of the size of the violation is summed up, i.e., we
        calculate<br /> <br />
        <div align="center">$$\varphi = \sum_{p_{i} &lt; l_{p_{i}}}(l_{p_{i}}-p_{i})^{2} + \sum_{p_{i} &gt; u_{p_{i}}}(p_{i}-u_{p_{i}})^{2} + \sum_{c_{j} &lt; l_{c_{j}}}(l_{c_{j}}-c_{j})^{2} + \sum_{c_{j} &gt; u_{c_{j}}}(c_{j}-u_{c_{j}})^{2}$$
        </div><br /> where the parameters are given by $p_{i} \in (l_{p_{i}},\,u_{p_{i}})$ and the constraints by
        $c_{i} \in (l_{c_{i}},\,u_{c_{i}})$ . The value $\varphi$ is used within the selection.
      </li>
      <li> Cross-over is always performed at gene boundaries so that no gene is ever disrupted. The number of cross-over
        points is a random number between zero and half the number of adjustable parameters (uniform distribution).
      </li>
      <li> Selection is done by the bubble sort described in [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography"
          href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Bibliography#Runarsson00/">Runarsson00</a>]. This sort
        incorporates a probability to compare objective values for individuals with a $\varphi \ne 0$. The pseudo code for the sort is:
        <pre class="codelisting" dir="ltr" style="overflow:auto;">// Here sweepNum is optimal number of sweeps from paper, i.e., TotalPopulation
for (i = 0; i &lt; sweepNum; i++)
  {
    wasSwapped = false;

    for (j = 0; j &lt; TotalPopulation - 1; j++)
      {
        // within bounds or random chance 
        if ((phi(j) == 0 and phi(j + 1) == 0) or UniformRandom(0, 1) &lt; Pf)
          {
            // compare objective function values
            if (Value(j) &gt; Value(j + 1))
              {
                swap(j, j + 1);
                wasSwapped = true;
              }
          }
        else // phi != 0 
          {
            // individual j further outside then j + 1
            if (phi(j) &gt; phi(j + 1))
              {
                swap(j, j + 1);
                wasSwapped = true;
              }
          }
      }

    // if no swap then break
    if (wasSwapped == false) break;
  }</pre>
      </li>
      <li> The initial population contains one individual whose genes are the initial parameter values, the genes of all
        other individuals are initialized to a random value between their boundaries. If the boundaries span two orders
        of magnitude or more, the random distribution is exponential, otherwise normal.
      </li>
      <li> Whenever the fittest individual has not changed for the last 10 generations, the 10% less fit individuals are
        replaced by individuals with random genes. When the fittest individual has not changed for 30 generations, the
        worse 30% are substituted by individuals with random genes. When the fittest individual has not changed for 50
        generations, the worse 50% are substituted by individuals with random genes. This procedure helps the algorithm
        escape local minima and is somewhat equivalent to increasing the mutation rate when the population has become
        uniform.
