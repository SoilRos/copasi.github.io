    The steady state is the state in which the state variables of the model, e.g. the species concentrations do not
    change in time. Mathematically this is expressed by setting the differential equations that describe the time
    evolution of the metabolic system to zero. This forms a system of algebraic non-linear equations. To solve them,
    COPASI can use a series of strategies using more than one numerical method.<br />
    <br />
    All calculations are done based on particle numbers and particle number rates rather than concentrations internally.
    The reduced model (see <a

      Interpretation of the Model</a>) is used. The Jacobian (which is used in the Newton method and when eigenvalues of
    the Jacobian are requested) is calculated using finite differences. The Eigenvalues of the Jacobian are calculated
    using LAPACK.<br />

      <dt><b>Use Newton</b></dt>
      <dd>This parameter is a Boolean value to determine whether to use the damped Newton method on the non-linear
        algebraic equations defining the steady-state. The initial concentrations set by the user are taken as guesses
        for the solution. A value of '1' (the default) indicates that COPASI shall use the damped Newton method.<br />
        <br />The damped Newton method is a variant of the famous Newton method for the solution of systems of
        non-linear equations. The solution is obtained from an iterative procedure that refines an initial guess until
        the residual error is smaller than required. If a limit number of iterations is reached without an acceptable
        solution, the method halts without a solution.<br /> <br />The iteration of the plain Newton method is:<br />
        <br />
        <div align="center">$x_{i} = x_{i-1}-\frac{f(x_{i-1})}{f'(x_{i-1})}$</div>
        <br /> <br />In the damped method if $x_{i-1}$ has a larger residual error than $x_{i}$ one looks at:<br /> <br />
        <div align="center">$x_{i}=x_{i-1}-\frac{f(x_{i-1})}{f'(x_{i-1})}\cdot2^{-n}$
          where $n=0, \ldots, 32$
        </div><br /> <br /> and accepts the first
        such value that has a smaller residual error than $x_{i}$. If none is found, the procedure halts without a
        solution (because it is at a local minimum).

      <dd> This parameter is a boolean value to determine whether to accept a steady-state, which contains negative
        concentrations. A value of '1' indicates that negative concentrations are acceptable whereas a value of '0' (the

      <dt><b>Resolution</b></dt>
      <dd> This is a positive numeric value to determine the resolution used to decide whether the current state is
        acceptable as a steady-state. If the absolute change of each state variable is smaller than the resolutions the
        state is accepted. The default is $10^{-9}$.<br /> <br /> Note, this value is interpreted as a
        concentration value, even though the calculation internally uses particle numbers. The reason for that is purely
        heuristic: In many cases the modeler will choose the units in a way that concentration values are neither
        extremely large nor extremely small numerically so that the default value for this parameter leads to useful
        results. However generally it is not save to just keep the default value without checking.</dd>
