      Separation</h3>
    In order to explain the basic notions of time scale decomposition we start with a first-order kinetics system. Then,
    the differential equations (ODE) describing the system dynamics ${\bf y}$ are linear:<br />
    <div align="center">
        $$ \frac{d\,{\bf y}}{d\, t} = {\bf J} \cdot {\bf y}$$
    </div>
    <br />
    with constant Jacobian ${\bf J}$. By using the set of right eigenvectors ${\bf A}$ of ${\bf J}$ as the new basis we
    can decompose the Jacobian [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography"
      href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Bibliography#Golub96/">Golub96</a>]<br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">
      $${\bf x} = {\bf A}^{-1} \cdot {\bf y}, \quad {\bf \Lambda} = {\bf A}^{-1} \cdot {\bf J} \cdot {\bf A}.$$
    </div><br />
    <br />
    The components of the transformed concentration vector ${\bf x}$ are called <i>modes</i>. Because ${\bf \Lambda}$ is
    a diagonal matrix of real or complex
    eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of ${\bf J}$, the transformed ODE system is fully decoupled:<br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">$$\frac{d\, x^i}{d\, t}=\lambda^i x^i, \ i=1,...,N.$$</div>
    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, the modes $x^i \sim e^{\lambda^i t}$ evolve independently of each other.
    The reciprocals of $\Re(\lambda^i):$<br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">$$\tau_i = -\frac{1}{\Re(\lambda^i)}$$</div><br />
    <br />
    have a dimension of time and are called time scales (TS). Ordering them w.r.t. magnitudes $\tau_1 &lt; \tau_2 &lt;
    ... &lt; \tau_N$ leads to approximate speed
    ranking of the modes [<a title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Bibliography"
      href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Bibliography#Lam93/">Lam93</a>]. The modes corresponding to fast time
    scales (eigenvalues with large negative real part) approach $0$ very quickly and can be eliminated from the system
    for $t \gg \tau_M$,
    where $\tau_M$ is a fast time scale.<br />
    <br />
    For general nonlinear problems the Jacobian is time-dependent. Its eigenvalues and eigenvectors change with
    time.<br />
    Hence, in order to obtain a reasonable characterization of the systems dynamics the time scale decomposition has to
    be applied repeatedly at many time points through the evaluation time of the reaction system.<br />
    <br />
    The methods presented here relies on the presence of a wide range of characteristic time-scales in biological
    systems and are based on the local analysis of the Jacobian, which is partitioned into fast and slow components at
    the initial point of a user chosen interval.<br />
    <br />
    All the three methods involves numerical integration using the LSODA solver [<a
