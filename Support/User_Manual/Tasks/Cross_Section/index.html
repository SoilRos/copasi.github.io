<h1>The cross-section task</h1>

<p>This tutorial describes how to use COPASI’s cross section
task. We begin by importing an oscillating model from the BioModel database,
and explore it through time course simulations before extracting some
characteristics using the cross-section task. </p>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>We start by downloading BioModel 239 (<a
href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/BIOMD0000000329">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/BIOMD0000000329</a>)
from the BioModels Database. Import the model into COPASI, and then navigate to
the Tasks, and there to Time Course. Specifying a duration of 100 seconds,
using an automatic interval size. Next we specify a plot for this simulation
run, by selecting the output assistant and creating a plot for “Concentrations,
Volumes, and Global Quantity Values”. By clicking on “Hide All” and then
clicking on the “[Calcium]” label we yield the following graph: </p>

<p>To investigate how this simulation behavior changes when a
parameter value is modified we use the slider feature of COPASI. For that
select Tools\Show Sliders from the menu or click the <img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0 width=24
height=28 style="display:inline" title="Slider Icon" alt="Slider Icon" id="Picture 2" src="images/image002.png"> button in
the tool bar. We define a new slider by clicking on “New Sliders”, and
selecting the “constant” parameter of reaction R2. </p>

<p>Note that the current value of the parameter is “2.9”, now
modifying the value in the range of 1.5 to 3 while looking at the plot we
notice that the dynamics of the oscillation changes from basic oscillations to
bursting. </p>

<h2>Cross-section</h2>

<p>With the cross-section task, we can detect crossings through
specified surfaces through the phase space. This is done by selecting a
variable, as well as a certain value as well as the direction of the crossing
we want to observe. For the purposes of this tutorial we want to look at the
peaks (or maxima) of the calcium oscillations obtained before. For that we
select the rate of calcium as variable in the cross-section task, waiting for
the value of 0 being crossed in the negative direction. We stop detecting the
cross-section after 100 seconds. </p>

<p><img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0

src="images/cross_section_options.png"></p>

<p>To capture the result, we alter the plot created before,
such that instead of using lines, circles are being used to represent the
values. </p>

<p>Now we are ready to run the cross section, yielding a result
of: </p>

title="Plot of the cross section result, showing only maxima"
src="images/cross_section_result.png"></p>

<p>Which are the maxima that we saw before when simulating the
model. </p>

<h3>Creating a bifurcation diagram</h3>

<p>We already know that the behavior of the oscillations change
when we modify the parameter of reaction “R2”, using the scan task in
combination with the cross-section task we can plot this in a bifurcation
diagram. First we define the scan task: we set up a scan, over R2.constant and
vary it in 100 intervals from 1.5 to 3. The subtask that should be carried out
is the “Cross Section”. Since we want to see the change in behavior we want to
track “output during subtask execution”.  </p>

<p><img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0 id="Picture 15"
alt="Defining the parameter scan"
title="Defining the parameter scan"
src="images/scan_setup.png"></p>

<p>Next we define he plot to be used. Here we want R2.constant
on the x axis and the concentration of calcium on the y axis. Again, we use
circles to represent the calcium concentrations rather than lines. (Alternatively
you could also select the output assistant and choose ‘Scan of Concentrations,
Volumes and Global Quantity Values’). </p>

<p><img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0 id="Picture 13"
alt="Plot of the scan result showing the change from a single peak to four peaks (bursting)"
title="Plot of the scan result showing the change from a single peak to four peaks (bursting)"
src="images/cross_section_scan.png"></p>

<p>This plot represents all the maxima that occur, and not just
those of the limit cycle. To improve the display, we tell the cross-section
task to only collect the crossings after some conditions are met. The condition
to specify is “time larger 50”. </p>

src="images/cross_section_option2.png"></p>

<p>Re-running the parameter scan we now get only those
crossings: </p>

alt="Refined scan result"
title="Refined scan result"
src="images/cross_section_scan_refined.png"></p>

<p>Using the other options in the cross-section task it is
possible to find crossings more efficiently. Those settings are grouped into
two sections: </p>

<p ><img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0 id="Picture 17"
alt="Cross section termination options"
title="Cross section termination options"
src="images/stop_options.png"></p>

<p>The first section determines when the simulation including
the detection of crossing points is terminated. Before we used this to stop
collecting crossings after 100 seconds. The other options mean: </p>
<ul>
<li>If crossings (#) larger: Stop after a given number of crossing
points is reported</li>

<li>If a crossing is repeated within tolerance: Stop after the
crossing points start repeating with a given relative accuracy. This would
typically indicate that the system has reached a limit cycle behavior. </li>

</ul>

<p>Note that a maximum time for the simulation must be provided
in any case, so that the simulation stops even when no crossings are detected
or the crossings do not repeat.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive  center-block" border=0 id="Picture 18"
alt="Cross section collection options"
title="Cross section collection options"
src="images/start_options.png"></p>

<p>The second set of settings determines when the reporting of
crossings is started. This is typically used to make sure that the output is
only started after the systems has reached a stable long term behavior, e.g. a
limit cycle. In the example, we used this to only collect crossings after 50
seconds, if this time interval is sufficient for the system to reach a limit
cycle. Other settings here: </p>

<ul>
<li>If crossing (#) larger: Start reporting only after a given number of crossings have been detected</li>
<li>If a crossing is repeated within tolerance: Start reporting only
after crossing points start to reoccur within the given tolerance. Typically,
this setting can be used when trying to detect a limit cycle, but it would not
be useful if e.g. chaotic behavior is expected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>As another example we show a route to chaos via period doubling bifurcations. The model is a chemical-reaction-kinetics analogon to Rössler’s simple chaotic attractor [1,2].</p>
<p>As in the previous example, we set up the cross section task to detect maxima of a variable (X2). The settings are chosen to allow a relatively efficient calculation of the bifurcation diagram:</p>
<ul>

<li>The plotting is started after at most 50 oscillations, but earlier, if a limit cycle is reached before that with an accuracy of 1e-5.</li>
<li>The plotting is stopped after 1000 time units or 50 detected maxima, whichever occurs earlier. Again, it is stopped earlier if a limit cycle is detected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scan task is set up to scan the autocatalytic expansion parameter from 0.05 to 0.2, and a plot with the scan parameter on the x axis and X2-concentration on the y axis is defined. </p>
