    An alternative interpretation is to consider the model as a stochastic process. In this case the reaction kinetics
    are not considered to describe the rates of change for the concentrations of involved species, but rather as a
    specification about the probability that a reaction event happens. If a reaction event happens the particle numbers
    of the involved species are updated according to their stoichiometries. That means particle numbers are always
    integer numbers and change discretely.<br />
    <br />
    Specifically the value of the kinetic function is interpreted as a so called propensity, that is a differential
    probability density that a reaction event will happen in the next infinitesimal time interval. However there are
    subtle differences between reaction rates and reaction propensities. One of those differences that only matters for
    rather small particle numbers is that e.g. the rate of a second order mass action reaction is described as 
    $k \left(\frac{S}{V}\right)^{2}$", while the propensity of the
    same reaction is $k \, \frac{S}{V} \, \frac{S-1}{V}$. COPASI will apply this kind
    of corrections automatically. In cases where these corrections have already been done by the modeler explicitly
    COPASI needs to be told not to apply this correction. This is described in the <a
      title="COPASI: Support/User Manual/Model Creation/General Model Settings"
      href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Support/User_Manual/Model_Creation/General_Model_Settings/">general model
      settings</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Another issue modelers should be aware of is that the rate laws for enzymatic reactions that are derived using the
    steady state approximation are not necessarily valid for stochastic simulation. In many cases they are, but the
    underlying assumptions for using them are not exactly the same as for deterministic simulations.<br />
