            <p><b>A conference featuring computational modelling research carried out using the software COPASI.</b> A forum where you can present your work and hear the latest research in modelling and simulation carried out with the software COPASI. This is a multidisciplinary conference covering many topics, such as cellular signalling, metabolism, immunology, and chemistry. COPASI is <a href="/Research/">a widely used</a> computational tool for the dynamics of systems of bio/chemical reactions. The conference will focus simultaneously on the research questions and their solutions, as well as on technical aspects of using COPASI. The conference features 3 invited speakers (see below), oral presentations selected from the submitted abstracts and posters.</p>

    <h2>Call for Abstracts</h2>
      <p><b>Abstract submission deadline</b>: 12<sup>th</sup> April, 2016.</p>
      <p>We solicit abstracts on computational analysis and simulation of biological and chemical systems carried out with COPASI. The conference brings together researchers from all areas of biology and chemistry who are interested in computational modelling of reaction networks. The abstracts should focus mainly on the scientific objectives of the work; they should only focus on methodology if that is the main goal of the work.  
      <p>Abstracts should be no longer than 500 words and must be <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmc160">submitted through EasyChair</a> (more information below). Oral presentations will be chosen from the submitted abstracts by the Scientific Committee.</p> 
        <p>Topics of interest are for example (but not exclusively):
	<ul>
		<li>systems biology,</li>
	         <li>dynamics of cellular processes (e.g. cell cycle),</li>
	         <li>metabolism,</li>
	         <li>signal transduction,</li>
	         <li>enzyme kinetics,</li>
	         <li>immunology,</li>
	         <li>synthetic biology.</li>
	         <li>physiology,</li>
	         <li>chemistry,</li>
	         <li>development of computational methods (including other software that makes use of COPASI),</li>
	         <li>development of laboratory methods aided by computation.</li>
	       </ul></p>
         <p>Submit your abstracts through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmc160">EasyChair</a>. You will have to create an account on EasyChair if you have not got one already (many conferences use this site to manage abstracts). Then add information about the authors and the text of the abstract (500 words or less and no figures) on the EasyChair submission form (you can paste text from your word processor there).</p>  
    <h2>Registration</h2>
      <p>Registration and abstract submission will open on February 19th. Registration is <b>free</b> and includes attendance in the conference, meals and refreshments.</p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>The conference will take place in the <a href="http://www.mib.ac.uk">Manchester Institute of Biotechnology</a> of the University of Manchester. Manchester is served by an International Airport and easy railway connections.</p>
