    <h3>Computational Modelling with COPASI 2016</h3>
    <h4>May 12-13 2016, Manchester, UK</h4>
      <p><i>Free registration!</i></p>
      <p><b>A conference featuring computational modelling research carried out using the software COPASI.</b>
      A forum where you can present your work and hear the latest research where an important component is 
      modelling and simulation carried out with the software COPASI. This is a multidisciplinary conference 
      covering many topics, such as cellular signalling, metabolism, immunology, and chemistry. COPASI is now
      <a href="/Research/">a widely used</a> computational tool for the dynamics of systems of bio/chemical 
      reactions. The conference will focus simultaneously on the research questions and their solutions, as
      well as on technical aspects of using COPASI.</p>
    <h4>Registration</h4>
      <p>Registration and abstract submission will open on February 19th. Registration is free and includes 
      attendance in the conference, meals and refreshments.</p>
    <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>The conference will take place in the <a href="http://www.mib.ac.uk">Manchester Institute of 
      Biotechnology</a> of the University of Manchester. Manchester is served by an International Airport and
      easy railway connections.</p>
    <h4>Scientific Committee</h4>
