    <h2>Computational Modelling with COPASI 2016</h2>
    <h3>May 12-13 2016, Manchester, UK</h3>
      <p><i>Free registration!</i></p>
      <p><b>A conference featuring computational modelling research carried out using the software COPASI.</b> A forum where you can present your work and hear the latest research in modelling and simulation carried out with the software COPASI. This is a multidisciplinary conference covering many topics, such as cellular signalling, metabolism, immunology, and chemistry. COPASI is now <a href="/Research/">a widely used</a> computational tool for the dynamics of systems of bio/chemical reactions. The conference will focus simultaneously on the research questions and their solutions, as well as on technical aspects of using COPASI.</p>
