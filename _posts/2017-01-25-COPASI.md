COPASI is part of de.NBI, the 'German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure'.

COPASI is part of de.NBI, the 'German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure' (for further information visit [de.NBI homepage](http://www.denbi.de)). 
The network provides comprehensive first-class bioinformatics services to users in life sciences research, industry and medicine.
