API documentation is now available online for the latest development release COPASI 4.0.20 as part of our [technical documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Technical_Documentation/).

The COPASI team is announcing the online availability of API documentation for the latest development release COPASI 4.0.20. In the future we plan to provide API documentation for both latest stable and development releases. 

The API documentation is still under development and not complete but we hope that it is already of some help for people working with the COPASI libraries, which can be build from the source packages.

To access the API documentation please goto the [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Technical_Documentation/C___API_Documentation/).
