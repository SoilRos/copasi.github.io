Language bindings for COPASI 4.8 (Build 35)

The download page for the language bindings should work now. Happy downloading and sorry for the delay.

New versions of the COPASI language bindings based on the latest COPASI
4.8 (Build 35) have been released.

Binary packages for Java and Python are available for the following
platforms:

Windows 32Bit and 64Bit
Linux 32Bit and 64Bit
Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6, 32Bit for Intel and PPC
Mac OS X 10.6 32Bit and 64Bit for Intel

The build system now allows building Perl 5, .NET, Octave and R bindings in addition to the Java and Python language bindings.
(Due to some issues with SWIG, the R bindings are not fully functional yet.)

There are also experimental packages for Perl 5 and .NET bindings for Mac OS X 10.6. Additional downloads for these languages for linux and windows will hopefully follow soon.
We also hope to be able to provide pre-compiled Octave bindings in the near future as well as support for Mac OS X 10.7 for most language bindings.
(The java bindings for Mac OS X 10.6 might actually work on Mac OS X 10.7, but this is untested.)

If you find that the language bindings don't work for you, please let us know.

Happy holiday!
