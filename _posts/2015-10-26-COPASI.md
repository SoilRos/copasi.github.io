Dear Colleagues,<br/><br/>
COPASI can only exist at this level through the generous support of 
funding agencies. We need to renew our grant from NIH that supports new 
developments in COPASI and maintenance but we need to prove that COPASI 
is widely used in research.

We need your help to document how COPASI is being used in research. 
We would appreciate if you could write a brief email stating how COPASI 
is useful in your research (or education) and how you would like to see 
it maintained and developed further.  (If you are also funded by the NIH 
then please state that as it is important.)

Please send your emails to
<b><script>mail2("hsoosp","ocapis",1,"?Subject=In%20support%20of%20COPASI","Stefan Hoops")</script></b> 
on or before Monday November 2, 2015.

Please edit the email address if you prefer it to be sent to mendes@ and 
the date, if you think it needs to be earlier.

Thanks in advance for your help and support.

The COPASI Team.
