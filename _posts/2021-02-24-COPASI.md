### Profiling COPASI's speed in versions 4.16 through to 4.30

#### Abstract

Recent changes to COPASI source code have resulted in a general performance increase. The aim of this work is to quantify the effective speed gains achieved in different simulation and analysis tasks. This is done by using specific models that challenge these tasks and are especially long to execute. This set of models and tasks will be useful for future comparisons to continue documenting the evolution of the software performance. COPASI version 4.30 is significantly faster than the previous release, 4.28, particularly in the most often used tasks: time course integration and steady state solution. It was also found that relative to version 4.16 (from August 2015) it can be several fold faster, thus users are urged to update to version 4.30.

#### Methods
Each test is contained in a single .cps file that contains a challenging model, the specific task marked as executable and a report file defined to capture the result (CPU time used, as measured internally by COPASI). The report is defined in append mode, which is convenient to run several tests with different versions and capture all in the same report file. Most COPASI versions will also output a line with their version number (except those prior to 4.24, which lack that capability and will simply output an empty line instead). Thus to run the test one needs only to issue the following command:

```bash
CopasiSE modelfile.cps
```

This runs the benchmark and appends the results (CPU time in seconds) to the *modelfile.out* file.  Note that *CopasiSE* should be the full path of CopasiSE of the appropriate  version to test. An example would be *\usr\local\COPASI-4.29.227-Linux-64bit\bin\CopasiSE* to test Build 227.

A few tests target the time taken to load a file, and in that case the measurement of time spent has to be carried out externally with the GNU  *time* command. Since the BASH shell also contains a *time* command, but which is not as flexible, one needs to actually call the command with the full pathname (in most Linux systems this is */usr/bin/time*). In those cases the command used to test those files should be:

```bash
CopasiSE | head -n 1 >> modelfile.out
/usr/bin/time -f "%e" -a -o modelfile.out CopasiSE --nologo modelfile.cps
```

This will provide a similar output as with the previous tasks, namely a first line with version number and another line with the time (in seconds) taken to process the file.

In order to enhance reproducibility the entire test suite was ran using a single single BASH script *copasispeedtests* that ran all the benchmarks in sequence. This  script has a number of local system dependencies encoded in environment variables at the top, which need to be appropriately configured to match the local requirements (file paths, etc.) 

#### Tests

Each benchmark file is designed to test a single COPASI function, such as simulation or analysis task, as well as model loading and parsing SBML. Table 1 lists all the benchmarks and their characteristics.

#### Results

This benchmark suite was used to profile the latest COPASI version (4.30) against a number of recent ones, listed in Table 2. All of the tests were run on a computer with a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700 CPU at 3.00 GHz running Slackware64 Linux and the Linux 64 bit binaries distributed by the COPASI project. The full set of results is available in the supplementary file  [Profile_4.16-4.30.tsv](https://github.com/copasi/COPASI/blob/develop/speed-test-suite/Profile_4.16-4.30.tsv), below is a summary of the important results.

The most recent version (4.30) proved to be generally faster than all the previous ones. A few tasks suffered only small changes in speed since the last version (4.29): file loading, time course with SDE integrator, and time scale separation analysis. Time course integrations with the Gillespie algorithm (direct method) and its derivatives (Gibson-Bruck, tau-leap, adaptive tau-leap and hybrid methods) increased in speed by a modest 10-20%. But a number of other tasks have gained considerable speedups: time course with LSODA (50%), time  course with RADAU5 (30%), steady state solution (45-72%), and Lyapunov exponents (88%). Most optimization algorithms are also faster, though this seems to be problem-dependent. Those with largest improvement were Praxis (48-68%), NL2SOL (44%), truncated Newtwon (33-58%), Hooke-Jeeves (30-50%), Nelder-Mead (22-53%), and Levenberg-Marquardt (21-47%).

Relative to version 4.16, the last version where the calculations were carried out from inside the model class, the speedup is often very large. Time course integration with LSODA being 3-fold faster, steady state calculations were 3 to 19-fold faster, Hooke-Jeeves optimization was 5-fold faster, and Levenberg-Marquardt optimization was an impressive 668-fold faster. 
  
#### Conclusion

The most recent version of COPASI, 4.30, is significantly faster than the previous release, 4.28, particularly in the most often used tasks: time course integration and steady state solution. Compared with older versions, which unfortunately are still cited in recent publications, version 4.30 can be several fold faster.
