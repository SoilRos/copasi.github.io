### Profiling COPASI's speed in versions 4.16 through to 4.30

#### Abstract

Recent changes to COPASI source code have resulted in a general performance increase. The aim of this work is to quantify the effective speed gains achieved in different simulation and analysis tasks. This is done by using specific models that challenge these tasks and are especially long to execute. This set of models and tasks will be useful for future comparisons to continue documenting the evolution of the software performance. COPASI version 4.30 is significantly faster than the previous release, 4.28, particularly in the most often used tasks: time course integration and steady state solution. It was also found that relative to version 4.16 (from August 2015) it can be several fold faster, thus users are urged to update to version 4.30.
