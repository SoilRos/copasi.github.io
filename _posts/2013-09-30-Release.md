The COPASI team announces the immediate availability of the stable
release COPASI 4.11 (Build 65).


There are no new features in this release. This is a maintenance
release, which resolves a list of issue present in previous
releases. A list of resolved issues can be found in the
[changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Change_History/COPASI_4_11_Build_65/).


__Note added Nov 4, 2013:__ We found a problem with the binaries of
build 64 and have corrected this with Build 65. There is no difference
in the source code so these two have exactly the same version (4.11),
the build number is the only distinction between the two. If you have
found problems importing SBML with Build 64 then please upgrade to
Build 65!  If you have not yet downloaded, then just use Build 65.
