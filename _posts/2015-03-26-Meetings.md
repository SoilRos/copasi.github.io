We will be holding another 3-day COPASI User workshop at the University of Manchester, UK, May 5-7 2015.

The COPASI team will be holding a 3-day User Workshop at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology of the University of Manchester, May 5-7 2015. 

The User Workshop takes the form of a combination of short lectures and hands-on sessions covering most of the COPASI simulation and analysis functions. The workshop will also include "model clinic" sessions where participants discuss with the team their own models and how best to analyse them. The workshop caters both for begginer as well as advanced users, and if needed we will arranged for separate tracks for these two types of participants. 

More information about the workshop, as well as a link to the registration page, can be found [http://www.copasi.org/tiki-index.php?page=Manchester2015&structure=Workshops_and_Tutorials|here]. 

Registration is free and includes lunch and coffee/tea breaks on all three days. Participants will have to arrange travel and accomodation from their own expenses. The [http://www.copasi.org/tiki-index.php?page=Manchester2015&structure=Workshops_and_Tutorials|Workshop web page] includes links to nearby hotels and more travel information.

Participants are requested to bring their own laptops and internet connections will be provided.

Looking forward to seeing you in Manchester on May 5-7!
