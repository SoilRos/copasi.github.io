The SBGN editors ask for feedback on how widely SBGN is used

For a number of years now a community of like minded Systems
Biologists have been developing a graphical notation that aims to
systematically and unambiguously draw biological pathways. The aim has
been to permit the exchange of pathway information graphically without
the need for supporting text. This standard is called the Systems
Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, [http://www.sbgn.org](http://www.sbgn.org)).

In order to understand how widely SBGN is used and whether the
notation meets your needs and we have developed a survey. It would be
of great assistance if you could complete the survey by following the
link below. It will only take about 10 minutes of your time.
