A new series of COPASI video tutorials has started on the ))YouTube(( channel ))CopasiTutorials((

A new form of documentation on how to use COPASI is now available: video tutorials. We have started publishing a series of tutorials on ))YouTube(( to act as practical hands-on demonstrations. This complements the existing online documentation and user forum. The series will consist of short videos, each one focused on a single topic. Two videos have already appeared: an overall introduction to COPASI's features, and a tutorial on how to create models with COPASI. 

The ))YouTube(( channel for these videos is [http://www.youtube.com/user/CopasiTutorials|CopasiTutorials], and the two available videos are [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pH16ema-Lg|Introduction to COPASI] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3IumEn9204|COPASI Model Creation].

New tutorials are already planned and will be posted soon, while many others will be created in the future. Subscribe to  [http://www.youtube.com/user/CopasiTutorials|CopasiTutorials] if you use ))YouTube((, or else visit this web site where ((VideoTutorials|they are on display)).
