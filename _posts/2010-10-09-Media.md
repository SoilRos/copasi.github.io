A new series of COPASI video tutorials has started on the YouTube 
channel: [CopasiTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/CopasiTutorials)

A new form of documentation on how to use COPASI is now available:
video tutorials. We have started publishing a series of tutorials on
YouTube to act as practical hands-on demonstrations. This complements
the existing online documentation and user forum. The series will
consist of short videos, each one focused on a single topic. Two
videos have already appeared: an overall introduction to COPASI's
features, and a tutorial on how to create models with COPASI.  

The YouTube channel for these videos is [CopasiTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/CopasiTutorials), and the two
available videos are
[Introduction to COPASI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pH16ema-Lg)
and 
[COPASI Model Creation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3IumEn9204). 

New tutorials are already planned and will be posted soon, while many
others will be created in the future. Subscribe to
[CopasiTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/CopasiTutorials) if you
use YouTube, or else visit the 
[Video Tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/Support/Video_Tutorials/) 
page where they are on display.
