The COPASI team announces the immediate availability of the user guide for COPASI 4.3 (Build 25).

The user documentation for COPASI has been updated to reflect the changes and new features in COPASI 4.3 (Build 25). This documentation is available for download in pdf format in the ((Documentation|documentation)) section or online in [tiki-integrator.php?repID=9|HTML format].

The html format has been improved in the following areas:
* We no longer rely on a browser's MathML or xhtml capabilities anymore, i.e., IE, Safari, Konqueror, Firefox, and other browsers display the mathematical equations.
* The document navigation is more user friendly.
* Citations are linked to the bibliography.
* Equations are properly labeled.
