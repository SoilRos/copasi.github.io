The COPASI Team is offering a [3 day boot camp](http://mbi.osu.edu/event/?id=757) at the
[Mathematical Biosciences Institute](http://mbi.osu.edu/) at
[Ohio State University](http://www.osu.edu/) from September 29 - October 1 2014. 

##The 3 day course will cover:

###Steady State Analysis (Day 1): 
A steady state happens when all the influxes and fluxes of the pools
and variables in a system are in balance, i.e. none of the variables
change in number, amount, or concentration.

###Optimization (Day 2):
Design problems are common in biotechnology where one normally seeks
to maximize a flux, a yield, or the concentration of an interesting
product.

###Parameter Estimation (Day 3):
To compare model results with the experimental data, one first has to
simulate the mathematical model, which we label the forward problem.
