The COPASI Team is offering a [http://mbi.osu.edu/event/?id=757|3 day boot camp] at the [http://mbi.osu.edu/|Mathematical Biosciences Institute] at [http://www.osu.edu/|Ohio State University] from September 29 - October 1 2014. 

!The 3 day course will cover:
!!Steady State Analysis (Day 1): 
A steady state happens when all the influxes and fluxes of the pools and variables in a system are in balance, i.e. none of the variables change in number, amount, or concentration.
!!Optimization (Day 2):
Design problems are common in biotechnology where one normally seeks to maximize a flux, a yield, or the concentration of an interesting product.
!!Parameter Estimation (Day 3):
To compare model results with the experimental data, one first has to simulate the mathematical model, which we label the forward problem.
