A user workshop will be held in the Manchester Institute of
Biotechnology, University of Manchester, in January 2013.

We are holding a free

This workshop, sponsored by the 
[BioPreDyn FP7 project](http://www.biopredyn.eu),
is designed to provide instruction on how to use COPASI's several
simulation and analysis methods. This includes deterministic and
stochastic simulation, parameter estimation, etc. The workshop will
also feature a presentation by Dr. Julio Banga, a collaborator from
the [BioPreDyn project](http://www.biopredyn.eu).
