Dear COPASI Users

A recent change in the way the list of MIRIAM resources is provided by
EBI makes it impossible to update MIRIAM resources in COPASI. We are
sorry for the inconvenience that this problem may be causing you. For
users who require the most recent list of MIRIAM resources we have
found a workaround: 

<!--more-->

Please download
[MIRIAMResources.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/copasi/COPASI/develop/copasi/MIRIAM/MIRIAMResources.xml)
and overwrite the existing file in the following location:

* Windows: %COPASIDIR%\share\copasi\config
* Mac: /Applications/COPASI/config
* Linux: [COPASI installation directory]/share/copasi/config

* Start CopasiUI and update the MIRIAM resources
* Close CopasiUI

The next time COPASI starts it will load the updated list.

Enjoy!

The COPASI Team.
