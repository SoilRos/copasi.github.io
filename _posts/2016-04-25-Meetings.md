The program for the Conference on Computational Modelling
with COPASI (May 12-13, 2016) has just been published.

## Program for 2016 Conference on Computational Modelling with COPASI

May 12-13, 2016 at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, <br/>
Manchester, UK <br/>
[http://www.copasi.org/Events/CMC16/Program]({{ site.baseurl }}/Events/CMC16/Program/)

We are pleased to have received many abstract submissions for this conference.
In addition to the three invited speakers, the Scientific Committee has selected
23 other talks for the conference. The full program, together with abstracts for
each talk is available at the URL above. 

This busy conference will include talks on topics such as enzymology, drug 
design, metabolism, signalling, ageing, and method development. Speakers come 
from 7 different countries, some as far as Costa Rica and Mexico, making the
meeting truly International.

__Registration, which is free, is still open until May 4__.

We will still accept abstracts for poster presentations until the close of
registration. Posters can be on computational analysis and simulation of
biological and chemical systems carried out with COPASI; both specific 
applications or method development are appropriate.
