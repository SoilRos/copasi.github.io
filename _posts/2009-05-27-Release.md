Updated language bindings for Build-30

Due to problems with the java bindings for build 30 under windows, we
have created a new version of those bindings which should solve those
problems. 

Everybody that did have problems using the COPASI java bindings in
CellDesigner should give this version a try. It has been tested by the
CellDesigner developers and it seems to work. 

Also everybody who writes programs using the COPASI language bindings
in combination with the language bindings for libsbml should update to
this new version. 

The binaries have already been uploaded to the german server and they
should appear on the U.S. server soon.
