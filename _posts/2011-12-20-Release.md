The COPASI team announces the immediate availability of the stable release COPASI 4.8 (Build 35).

A new stable release of COPASI has been made available. Please visit our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Hidden/Obsolete/Download/Free_Version_Artistic_License_2_0" >free download</a> page to retrieve this latest stable release. Please note this version is released under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Download/License" >Artistic License 2.0</a>, which is an [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) approved license. This license allows non-commercial and commercial use free of charge. This release is mainly a bug fix release which increases the stability and usability of COPASI. It therefore contains only few new features.

__New features since the previous stable release:__
* Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
** Added plots and reports for parameter scans to the output assistant.
** Only applicable plots and reports are shown in the output assistant by default.
* Simulation Engine
** Time Scale Separation Analysis can now handle multi compartment models.
** The Time Scale Separation Analysis can now be applied to the full as well as the reduced model.
** It is now possible to calculate the sensitivities of Eigen values.
** Add kinetic function Bi (irreversible) to the builtin functions.
