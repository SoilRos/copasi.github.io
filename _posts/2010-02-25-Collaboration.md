The COPASI team, through Dr. Stefan Hoops, initiated a collaboration
with the group of [Dr. Yang Cao](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ycao/), from
Virginia Tech's Computer Science Department. The collaboration is

The COPASI team, through Dr. Stefan Hoops, initiated a collaboration
with the group of [Dr. Yang Cao](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ycao/), from
Virginia Tech's Computer Science Department. The collaboration is
focused on improving stochastic simulation methods. Cao's team are
leaders in algorithms for stochastic simulation, particularly those
that take into account the stiffness of the dynamics. The
collaboration is to include these algorithms in COPASI such that they
benefit a large number of users. Currently the work is being carried
out by Ao-ping Hou, an MSc student, and has already resulted in a new
algorithm and speed improvements in the existing ones. At the moment
Ao-ping is working on a implementation of a self adjusting Tau-Leap
method, which will later be incorporated in COPASI.
