      Stochastic Differential Equations have the form:
      \begin{equation}
      dX = f(t,X) \, dt + g(t,X) \, dW
      \end{equation}
     
      Where the regular ODE is given by $f(t,X) \, dt$ and the noise is 
      given by $g(t,X) \, dW$). Please note that $f(t,X)$ 
      and $g(t,X) \, dW$ are vectors. In general the noice terms are 
      independ stochastic processes with mean 0, i.e., we have one stochastic variable 
      for each integration variable.

      Let us look at a chemical reaction system in which the deterministic part is given by:
      \begin{equation}
      f(t,X) = N\, v(t,X)
      \end{equation}
      where $N$ is the $m$ x $n$ stoichiometry matrix, $m$ the number of species and $n$ 
      the number of reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assure that the stochastic term does not violate mass conservation the random 
      variables may no longer be independent. We introduce the following stochastic term 
      where $\tilde{g}(t,X) \, d\widetilde{W}$ is a vector of dimension $n$.
      \begin{equation}
      g(t,X) \, dW = N \, \tilde{g}(t,X) \, d\widetilde{W}
      \end{equation}
      Here $\tilde{g}(t,X) \, d\widetilde{W}$ are independ stochastic processes with mean 0. Since 
      the linear combination of independent mean 0 processes leads to a mean 0 process $g(t,X) \, dW$
      has still mean 0 as required.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads us to the following SDE for chemical reaction systems which obviously does
      not violate the mass conservation.
      \begin{equation}
      dX = N \left( v(t,X) \, dt + \tilde{g}(t,X) \, d\widetilde{W} \right)
      \end{equation}
