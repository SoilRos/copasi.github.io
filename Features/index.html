    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>COPASI carries out <i>simulation</i> and <i>analysis</i> of biochemical networks.</p>
    <h2>Simulation</h2>
    <p>Simulation can be performed either with stochastic kinetics or with differential equations, 
    and the software easily allows swithcing between them.</p>
    <p>Algorithms available for simulation:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>LSODAR for ordinary differential equation modeling;</li>
       <li>Gillespie's direct method for exact stochastic kinetics;</li>
       <li>Gibson &amp; Brooke's version of Gillespie's algorithm for exact stochastic kinetics;</li>
       <li>&tau;-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics</li>
       <li>Adaptive SSA/&tau;-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics</li>
       <li>Hybrid Runge-Kutta/SSA for hybrid simulations with stochastic kinetics and differential equations</li>
       <li>Hybrid LSODA/SSA for hybrid simulations with stochastic kinetics and differential equations</li>
    </ul>
