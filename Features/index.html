    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>COPASI carries out <i><b>simulation</b></i> and <i><b>analysis</b></i> of biochemical network 
     <i><b>models</b></i>.</p>
    <h2>Models</h2>
    <p>Models in COPASI are based on <i>reactions</i> that convert a set of <i>species</i> into 
     another set of <i>species</i>. Each <i>species</i> is located in a <i>compartment</i>, which is 
     a physical location with a size (volume, area, etc). This maps directly to biochemical reaction 
     networks, but can also represent other types of processes (for example, the species could be
     cell types). COPASI automatically converts the reaction network to a set of differential equations 
     or to a system of stochastic reaction events &mdash; the user does not have to write down the math
     explicitly, the software does that. Models can also have:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Unlimited number of species, reactions, and compartments.</li>
       <li>Arbitrary discrete events; these can be used to change the model, or just to monitor 
       the progress of simulations.</li>
       <li>Arbitrary differential equations; these have to be added explicitly by the user and can
       be mapped to species, compartments, or generic variables.</li>
       <li>Compartments can have variable sizes (ie they can be variables of the model).</li>
       <li>The rates of reaction can be picked from a set of predefined kinetic functions (the most
       common in biochemistry), or arbitrary functions defined by the user.</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Simulation</h2>
    <p>Simulation can be performed either with stochastic kinetics or with differential equations, 
    and the software easily allows swithcing between them.</p>
    <p>Algorithms available for simulation:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>LSODAR for ordinary differential equation modeling.</li>
       <li>Gillespie's direct method for exact stochastic kinetics.</li>
       <li>Gibson &amp; Brooke's version of Gillespie's algorithm for exact stochastic kinetics.</li>
       <li>&tau;-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics.</li>
       <li>Adaptive SSA/&tau;-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics.</li>
       <li>Hybrid Runge-Kutta/SSA for hybrid simulations with stochastic kinetics and differential equations.</li>
       <li>Hybrid LSODA/SSA for hybrid simulations with stochastic kinetics and differential equations.</li>
    </ul>
